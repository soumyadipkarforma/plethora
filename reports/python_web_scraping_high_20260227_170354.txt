Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites automatically. Python is widely used for web scraping because of its easy syntax and powerful libraries likeBeautifulSoup,ScrapyandSelenium. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use these Python tools to scrape data from websites and understand why Python 3 is a popular choice for web scraping tasks.
The requests library is used for making HTTP requests to a specific URL and returns the response. Python requests provide inbuilt functionalities for managing both the request and response.
If requests is not installed, install it using:
pip install requests
Example:In this example, we are sending a GET request to a webpage using therequests.get()method, then printing the response status code and the page content returned by the server.
Output
Explanation:
For more information, refer to ourPython Requests Tutorial.
Once the raw HTML is fetched, the next step is to parse it into a readable structure. That’s where BeautifulSoup comes in. It helps convert the raw HTML into a searchable tree of elements.
If requests is not installed, install it using:
pip install beautifulsoup4
Example:Here, we first send an HTTP request to the webpage, then use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and format it in a clean, readable structure.
Output
Explanation:
At this point, the HTML is ready to be searched for tags, classes or content.
Once we have parsed the HTML using BeautifulSoup, the next step is to locate and extract specific content from the page. Websites usually wrap their main article content inside tags with identifiable classes like<div class="article--viewer_content">. We can target such elements and pull out useful data like text, links or images.
Example:In this example, we'll extract all paragraph (<p>) text from the main content section of theGeeksforGeeks Python Tutorialpage.
